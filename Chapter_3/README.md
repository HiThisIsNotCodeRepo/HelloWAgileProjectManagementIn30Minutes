*Top 3 Differences between Agile and Waterfall*

1. Short Iterative Cycles vs One Long Project Lifecycle
    - Agile promotes short iterative cycle which allow for continual improvement, changes in requirements during the
      build and a collaborative/geographically co-located project and business team.
    - Waterfall is predicated on doing something only once, getting it right first time and minimising changes.
    - If the cost is high then agile method could be expensive, and it will elongate the delivery timeline. On the other
      hand no matter how long we analyse the requirement it will not be perfect in reality the needs are changing
      constantly.
2. Conversations vs Documentation
    - Daily stand up is good to prioritise task and remove blocker, however we should extend this information to other
      stakeholders as well.
3. Self Organising Teams vs Hierarchical Structure
    - Empowering a team to make day-to-day decisions is essential, but to suggest they can make all decisions relating
      to the project is risky.
