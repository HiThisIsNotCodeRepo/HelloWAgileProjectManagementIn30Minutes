# Chapter 5

*Planning Approach*

1. Get the experts in a room.
    - To include all relevant stakeholder.
2. Brainstorm the deliverables, what 'things' must be delivered for this project to be successful.
    - Supplier Selection - Request for Proposal(RFP) Processes
    - Discovery/Scoping
    - Customer Journeys
    - Requirements
    - Communication
    - IT Development/System Change
    - Target Operating Model
    - Business Processes
    - Testing/UAT
    - Training
    - Marketing/Branding/Website
    - MI(Management Information and Reporting)
    - Documentation(This could be customer correspondence, project documentation, etc)
    - Business Readiness(What do the business teams need to do to prepare for the change)
3. Break each of the above deliverables into next level of activities/tasks: it's a good idea to assign resources at
   this stage. Not necessarily named individuals, but ojb roles and quantity.
4. Identify the basic dependencies(an activity which cannot start before another is complete)
5. Now the tricky part - timelines: ask the group to estimate based on what's known about the deliverable of the Project
   and from a consensus.
    - It will take X weeks to gather medium level requirements
    - There will be X sprints to develop a minimal viable product/proposition(MVP) system/digital journey
    - It will take X months to test
    - It will take X weeks to write training material.
6. Sprint Planning

*Stakeholders/customer engagement*

1. Identifying and engaging with the end customers or user groups to visualise the project goals and desired outcomes is
   the first.
2. The second is the identification of stakeholders and how the project will communication with the different
   stakeholders.

*Customer Engagement*

Customer engagement means spending time with the customers, understanding what they do, what problems they have, how
they are currently getting around those problems and how they would like to operate in the future.

*Requirements gathering*

Types of requirements:

- High-Level Requirements
- Detailed Requirements

Agile will purport high-level requirements are sufficient to plan and you can dig down into the detail whilst writing
the individual user stories.

Waterfall requires detailed requirements and design documents before a developer gets anywhere near a keyboard.

*A Process for Gathering Requirements*

1. Start with the vision: Geoffrey Moore's template:
    1. For(target customer)
    2. Who(statement of need or opportunity)
    3. The(product name) is a (product category)
    4. That(key benefit reason to buy)
    5. Unlike(primary competitive alternative)
    6. Our Product(statement of primary differentiation)
2. Customer Journeys.
3. High-Level Requirements
4. Medium Level Requirement
    - If you are working with an Agile development team, they may push to begin build. Encouraging you to focus on a
      high priority Feature, break it down into Epic User Stories(Medium-sized requirement) and then head straight into
      the User Stories for that Epic.
5. Detailed Requirement

*Top three requisites a project manager needs to fulfil*

1. Control.
2. Visibility.
3. Pace
